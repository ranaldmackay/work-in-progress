There is a convention when learning a programming language to start with a simple program which prints the phrase "Hello World" to the programmers screen.

It seems an appropriate title for a first post to my embryonic website. Whilst it isn't my first foray into website design and development, part of the purpose of publishing this site is to delve back into some of the technologies I've used in the past and expand my knowledge and understanding of them.

At it's most basic level a website is a beautifully simple thing ... all the information you want to convey wrapped up in simple Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) for your browser to translate into information on your screen.

Want to make it look prettier? Add in some Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and you can gain control over the positioning and presentation of all your HTML elements.

Need to include some interactivity with those beautifully styled HTML elements? Add in some Javascript and Hey Presto, you can have yourself a pretty neat website.

It couldn't be simpler, obviously.

Of course, it is only as simple as you want to make it. The advances in website design since Tim Berners-Lee gave us [http://info.cern.ch/](http://info.cern.ch/), driven in part by the proliferation of devices we can consume the World Wide Web on, requires an ever growing demand for increasingly complicated code.

In reality it quickly turns into a complicated dance between the three languages in a bid to make your browser display the website I want you to see.

At the time of writing this site consists of only HTML, no CSS styling, no clever Javascript. This post is really just a tool to help me determine the layout of the page. I'm building it with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) which speeds up my development whilst making maintenance of the site easier as it grows.

And that's enough for a first post to let me get back to coding. As the development of the site takes place I intend to document what I've done and why I did it, mostly as a reminder for myself. If someone stumbles across this and finds it helpful though, that's all the better.
